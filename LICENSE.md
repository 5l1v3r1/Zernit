This is done to protect the intelectual property untill following stub version is finished.

This section of this license identified as 'stub version' is not yet in effect.

=== START OF STUB VERSION ===

This license is now voided until finished into a production to replace current license by which it's meant to be announced the change by the original creator of this project (github.com/kreyren)

Expecting
- Paid for commercial use (small fee maybe depending on the amount of employees) unless said person is actively contributing to the repository (free-of-charge)
- Do not allow keeping the source code closed
- Forks are allowed only for contribution unless upstream prevents implementation (excluding changes to the license over which the upstream has full control for obvious reasons, but allow contributions to the license) of a feature for which the fork would be allowed as standalone (This is made to direct the workflow)
  - Add method to handle projects that rewrite this in a different programming language -> Host in our organization
- Anyone can request additional rights for the use of this software (We try to make this as free as possible with the option to finance the development)
- Paid for non-contributing users?
  - Since non-contributing users are basically investment (usually with low return value) of our resources and to encourage contribution in docummentation, etc..?
