Disclaimer: This is still part of ongoing effort to make this repository FSF approved while allow for sustainable business plan assuming this repository being expected to be used for commercial use.
Content provided in this post is subject to change and contributions are welcommed where we are welcomming challenges about these decisions and requests to adapt license for your workflow.

Based on feedback from majority of Free Software Foundation members based on discussion in https://forum.members.fsf.org/t/help-me-with-gpl-3-inspired-license-designed-for-commercial-use-and-to-avoid-segmentation/1953/59 this repository does not comply with four freedoms as follows where we are doing our best on ongoing effort to make this project compliant while allowing sustainable business plan:

- The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0).

Usage of software is restricted by the license to direct the workflow in original repository since segmentation as example provided with ripple project on https://github.com/osuripple/lets/pull/5 to avoid segmentation alike https://github.com/light-ripple and many others that based on our point of view only sabotages the original project.

- The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for this.

We believe that this is not restricted since the project is open-source and you are allowed to perform any changes where the features that can be merged in original project are required to be merged where we will grant you write access based on proved competence to maintian said part with planned option to get paid for this service.

If the fork does not have a feature that could be merged in the project itself then we allow this fork.

- The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others (freedom 2).

This is restricted since spread of malware of outdated versions of this project is a concern.

License is planned to contain conditions to avoid this unwanted behavior.

- The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3). By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.

This is not restricted for standalone forks as long as said repositories are not containing features that project finds usefull in which scenario we will provide an official way for said feature to be merged in our upstream without restricting your right to have access in said code assuming that you are competent enough to perform such maintainance. If not we do our best to teach you.
